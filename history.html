                    <p>This two-story masonry building with a granite foundation is Montana’s oldest theatre still in operation.
                        It was built by Angus A. McDonald and his wife JoAnna, in July 1981 on property first deeded by the
                        Northern Pacific Railroad before it was acquired by the McDonalds. Angus was an early Philipsburg
                        rancher, mining developer and property owner, who was also a county commissioner. First known as
                        the McDonald Opera House, it was built with a flat roof that has a metal covered stage loft, double hung
                        windows with segmental arches and granite sills on the second floor and was equipped with dressing
                        rooms beneath the south end.
                    
                        The McDonald Opera House Theatreo, built in 1889 is the oldest continuously operated theatre in
                        Montana. Over the last 125 plus years, this theatre has had one main goal: to provide entertainment,
                        education and artistic escape to the residents and visitors of Flint Creek Valley.

                        <h3>The Granada The Opera House Theater</h3>
                        <p> Owned by Tim and Claudette Dringle from 1987 – 2018, the Opera House Theatre provided live
                                productions each summertime. Offering three productions each summer (usually vaudevillian, comedic
                                and dramatic) Thursdays – Sundays. Over the years, the Opera House Theatre developed a great
                                reputation and attracted a vast following, drawing from all over Montana and the Northwest. It was
                                with much sadness to dedicated patrons when the Dringles announced their retirement in fall 2018.</p>

                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <h3>The Philipsburg Theatre/Philispburg Playhouse Productions</h3>
                    <p> The Philipsburg Theatre was purchased by Michael and Barbara McDowell in 2019. As the new stewards
                        for the McDonald Opera House Theatre, the McDowells have to decided to have a more varied offering
                        and reinvent the space as more of a community theatre space. To that end, they pulled together a team
                        that created a non-profit organization (Philipsburg Playhouse Productions) that is the sole tenant in a
                        long term lease renting out the theatre space.
                        Mission Statement: Philipsburg Playhouse Productions is a Montana Nonprofit Organization
                        dedicated to inspiring and supporting the hamlet of Philipsburg with entertainment, enrichment
                        and education through community collaborations by:
                        a) Coordinating entertainment, artistic productions and community events
                        b) Showcasing local talent and traveling artists, and
                        c) Developing and supporting affordable arts programs.
                        Vision: We envision a thriving town of Philipsburg where businesses and community ideas
                        collaborate into vibrant opportunities of artistic expressions showcased in the town’s
                        magnificent theatre as a warm, inclusive space for residents and visitors to enjoy film, music and
                        the arts.</p>
